The iofiles.zip file contains Freescale Kinetis iofiles from CodeWarrior/Processor Expert for MCU. 
These peripheral memory maps can serve when cloning an existing BSP to a specific Kinetis processor derivative. 
The MQX has not been tested with these IO maps, they are included just for the cloning purposes.
